  "ChemicalOpsGovernor — the independent safety/traceability layer for
  the ISCO-08 3133 chemical processing plant operations coordination
  actor. Wired as its own `:govern` node in `chemical-ops.actor`'s StateGraph,
  downstream of `:advise` — the Advisor has no notion of plant provenance
  or operational risk, so this MUST be a separate system able to reject a
  proposal (itonami actor pattern, per ADR-2607011000 / CLAUDE.md Actors section).

  `check` is a pure function of (request, context, proposal, store) ->
  verdict; it never mutates the store. The StateGraph's `:decide` node
  routes on the verdict:
    :hard? true                → :hold  (irreversible, no write)
    :escalate? true            → :request-approval (interrupt-before)
    otherwise                  → :commit

  HARD invariants (:hard? true, ALWAYS :hold, never overridable):
    1. plant provenance        — the request's plant-id must be registered and verified.
    2. no-actuation            — proposal :effect must be :propose.
    3. no-reactor-control      — proposal :op must NOT be :reactor-control,
                                 :chemical-injection, :process-start,
                                 or :emergency-shutdown (those are exclusively
                                 licensed operator authority, never automated).

  ESCALATION invariants (:escalate? true, ALWAYS human sign-off):
    4. :op :flag-anomalous-reading  — always escalates (high-safety signal).
    5. low confidence (< `confidence-floor` = 0.7)."
