(ns chemical-ops.advisor
  "ChemicalOpsAdvisor protocol — advisors for chemical processing plant
  operations coordination proposals. The Advisor ingests a request (plant ID,
  operation type, telemetry) and returns a proposal with :effect :propose.
  Advisors never directly write state or dispatch actuation (the Governor
  and StateGraph Actor gate that).

  Concrete implementations: `mock-advisor` (deterministic, for testing)
  and `llm-advisor` (wraps an LLM).")
