  "ChemicalOpsActor — the ISCO-08 3133 chemical processing plant
  operations coordination actor as a `langgraph.graph/state-graph`
  (per ADR-2607011000 / CLAUDE.md Actors section). One graph run = one
  operations coordination request (intake → advise → govern → decide →
  commit/hold, with a human-approval interrupt for escalated proposals).
  No infinite internal loop; checkpointed per superstep so an interrupted
  run can resume after human sign-off.

  CRITICAL DESIGN NOTE: This actor supports plant-operator BACK-OFFICE
  COORDINATION WORKFLOW only. It does NOT directly control chemical reactors,
  injection systems, process units, or emergency shutdown — those
  remain exclusively under licensed plant operators' human authority.
  The Governor enforces this hard boundary (see `chemical-ops.governor`).

  State graph:
  ```text
  :intake -> :advise -> :govern -> :decide -+-> :commit           (:ok? true)
                                             +-> :request-approval  (:escalate? true, interrupt-before)
                                             +-> :hold              (:hard? true)
  ```

  The unconditional invariant: the ChemicalOpsAdvisor can never directly
  commit a record or dispatch a robot action the ChemicalOpsGovernor
  refuses — every commit-record! call is gated behind `:decide`."
